<h1>Errata<div style="font-size: 70%"><a class="subtlelink" href="index.html">Eloquent JavaScript</a></div></h2>

<p>These are the known mistakes in the <strong>second edition</strong> of the book. For
errata in the first edition,
see <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/errata.html">this
page</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>Page 4</strong>: The sentence “You can probably imagine
how how tedious…” duplicates the word <em>how</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>Page 159</strong> (The Date Type):
The <code>findDate</code> function produces the wrong months. The
second argument given to <code>new Date</code> should
be <code>Number(match[2]) - 1</code>, subtracting one to compensate
for the fact that months start at zero in this interface.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>Page 185</strong> (Slow-Loading Modules): In the code
snippet for <code>define</code>, the second use of
the <code>every</code> method is incorrect. The call should be
to <code>myMod.onLoad.forEach</code> instead.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>Page 192</strong> (Parsing): The example Egg program has
its parentheses distributed incorrectly. One closing parentheses from
the second line should be moved to the end of the last line.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><strong>Page 242</strong> (Mouse Motion): The example
uses <code>event.which</code> to detect mouse button release. This
only works in Chrome and Safari. See
the <a href="14_event.html#c_xBQPHox4ts">updated code</a>
and <a href="14_event.html#p_fndkFYbayW">comment</a> for a better
way.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><strong>Page 281</strong> (Curves): The text refers to
the <code>bezierCurve</code> method. This method is actually
called <code>bezierCurveTo</code> (as in the example code).</p>

<p><strong>Page 282</strong> (Curves): Where it says the picture shows
a line from the left of the circle to the left of the quarter circle,
it should definitely say <em>right</em> in both instances.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p><strong>Page 312</strong> (Summary): The code example uses
the <code>statusCode</code> property. This does not exist, since the
property is actually called <code>status</code>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p><strong>Page 327</strong> (Summary): “When the user has selected
a <em>field</em>” should be “When the user has selected
a <em>file</em>”.
